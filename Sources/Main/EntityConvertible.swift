     Maps this instance to a managed object 'MO' that has the same properties and can be persisted.

     - Return nil if the model doesnâ€™t satisfy the constraints of the managed object.
     - Upsert if needed. For instance, if the MO defines a unique property constraint
       you should fetch and update instead create a new one.
     - Set (or update) the MO properties with those of the model.

     - Returns: A managed object with the same properties, or nil if this model is invalid.
