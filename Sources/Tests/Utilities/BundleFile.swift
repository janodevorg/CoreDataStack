    /**
     Reads a file from a bundle.

     What you should pass as bundle parameter:
     - If the file is in a Xcode project use `Bundle.main` or `Bundle(identifier:)`.
     - If the file is in a SPM package use `Bundle.module`.

     However,
     - if this class is used from a unit test,
     - and the file is in the target under test,

     you will have to expose the `Bundle.module` of the target under test writing a class like this
     inside the target:
     ```
     public enum BundleReference {
         public static let bundle = Bundle.module
     }
     ```

     Note that writing `Bundle(of: ClassUnderTest.self)` will not give you the bundle of the target
     under test.

     - Parameters:
       - filename: Filename including extension, e.g. `file.txt`.
       - bundle: Bundle of the target containing the file.
